# accelerator-jira-exp-api

The Accelerator Jira Experience API listens to Issue updates from Jira
and publishes them to Anypoint MQ.

Note: Due to Jira webhook limitations, basic authentication cannot be 
enabled for this API.

## Available operations

### Post issue update

The endpoint `post:/issue-updates` is implemented to receive updates. The
request body of this API is the webhook request generated by Jira.

## Prerequisite setup

- Create the following exchange and queues in Anypoint MQ
  1. accelerator-salesforce-update-case-dl-queue
  1. accelerator-salesforce-update-case-queue
  1. accelerator-salesforce-update-case-exchange
- Add the queue and exchange names to the properties file
- Create the webhook in Jira by following the setup guide and update the app 
url to receive updates from Jira
